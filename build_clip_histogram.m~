%% use this function to convert a video clip's raw features into hist gram that is usable in LDA
% INPUTS:
% clipFeatureMatrix is the F x D feature matrix for the video
% codebook is the C x D dictionary
% type is either 'vq' or 'llc'
%
% OUTPUTS
% hist is the 1 x C clip histogram

% this probably didn't need its own function....
